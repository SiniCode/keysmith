# Weekly Report: Week 4

## Completed Tasks (20 hours)
* I did the peer review and improved my code according to the feedback I got.
* I studied things related to encryption, decryption, and padding and started writing code for those. (Not working yet.)

## What next?
* I will hopefully get encryption and decryption working with fresh eyes and ideas, and add those functionalities to the gui.
* I will write tests for encryption and decryption and start performance testing.
* I will complete the documentation.

## Questions
* Are there any recommended materials that would help to understand adding and removing padding better?
