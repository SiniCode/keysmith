# Implementation

## Structure

### Services
All the functionality that the app provides is inside the *services* package.
These services are further divided into
* key creation functions
* encryption functions (not implemented yet)
* decryption functions (not implemented yet)

### User Interface
The app has a simple graphical user interface that can be found in a separate package, *ui*.
There are three different views:
* key creation view
* encryption view (not implemented yet)
* decryption view (not implemented yet)
The UI class shows one of these views at a time.
