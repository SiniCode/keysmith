# Weekly Report: Week 3

## Completed Tasks (8 hours)
* I studied the [Extended Euclidean algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Euclidean_algorithm) and the rest of RSA key creation.
* I completed the code for key creation
* I wrote automated unit tests for key creation
* I started writing the testing document and added more information about the algorithms to the project specification

## What next?
* I will study how to use the keys to encrypt and decrypt messages and write code for that
* I will create the graphical user interface

## Questions
* Does the [key creation](https://github.com/SiniCode/keysmith/blob/main/src/services/keys.py) part seem ok? Is there something I should reconsider?
